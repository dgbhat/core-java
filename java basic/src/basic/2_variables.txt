Rules for naming variables

names are case-sensitive;
a name can include Unicode letters, digits, and two special characters ($, _);
a name cannot start with a digit;
a name must not be a keyword (class, static, int are illegal names)

Here are some valid names of variables:
number, $ident, bigValue, _val, abc, k, var

And here are some invalid ones:
@ab, 1c, !ab, class

Since Java 9 the single character _ is an invalid name for a variable, but _a and __ (double _ ) are legal names.

Note that to keep backward compatibility the word var can be used as a variable name even after Java 10 was released.
