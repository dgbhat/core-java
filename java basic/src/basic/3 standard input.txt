The standard input is a stream of data going into a program. It is supported by the operating system

import java.util.Scanner;
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

There are two ways to read STRINGS with a Scanner class.
1.
If your input is an integer number or a single word, you can read the data using next().
String name = scanner.next();
But, if the user prints a compound name like "Erich Maria", the program will output only the first word.
The next() method reads one word only and doesn't include any whitespace. (Trailing space is left out)

2.
nextLine() method, which reads and outputs the whole line:
The nextLine() method includes all space characters it encounters.


The more correct term to refer to what we’ve called “word” is token: it is a piece of text surrounded by whitespace. We can say now that the next() method finds and returns the next token

nextLine() reads all data till the end of the current line.
