The Java programming language provides operators to perform arithmetic operations:

addition +
subtraction -
multiplication *
integer division /
remainder %

+5 , -8 etc
They both have a higher level of precedence than the multiplication and division operators.


The precedence order:
parentheses
unary plus/minus
multiplication, division
addition, subtraction
