Java Basics

    default value of int is 0

    default value of String is null

    Non Static methods/variables: Non-static methods/class variables can be accessed with INSTANCE of that class(ie with that OBJECT), can not be accessed directly.

    Constructor: scope=PUBLIC, dataType= no data type.

    "main" is not a keyword of java. It is used in psvm as main, it is defined as main in JVM. And it CANT be changed as per the java specs.

    pring() and println()

    The name of a variable cannot start with a digit

Classes

    Every Java program must have at least one class

    it must not start with a digit

Inheritance

    Subclass helps reduce code duplicacy

    <extends> : Subclass needs to call super() in its constructor because a child obj has to inherit all the properties of parent

Interfaces [ABSTRACT METHODS]

    A common utility containing list of methods without implementation. The classes that IMPLEMENT the interface must implement all these methods

    Abstract methods do not have method body

POLYMORPHISM [ABSTRACT CLASS and ABSTRACT METHODS]

    To define Common Properties in Super Class. ex, move() method in <class>Animal<class/> => Bird moves differently than Mammal(Polymorphism). move() must be implemented in <class>Bird,Mammal</class>

    Objects can not be created from an Abstract class. It has to be extended if we need to create an object of its properties

String

    substring(startIndex, EndIndex); => EndIndex is non-inclusive
